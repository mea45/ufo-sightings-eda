# Exploratory Data Analysis of UFO Sightings Using Python

This is the first project I worked on for my data analytics portfolio. The main goal was to get reacquainted with Python and the different packages I used for data visualization a couple of years ago. This is also the first project I used Jupyter Notebook for. The dataset that is used in this project comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings). It contains over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings including location, date, time and duration of the sightings. Almost all sightings come with a short comment. 

There are two parts to this projects. In the [first part](https://github.com/manalelabdellaoui/ufo-sightings-eda/blob/main/preprocessing.ipynb), the dataset was cleaned up and prepared for further analysis. In the [second part](https://github.com/manalelabdellaoui/ufo-sightings-eda/blob/main/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb), we took a deeper dive into the data and performed some explantory analysis.
